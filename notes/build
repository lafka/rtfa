A build is something to run.

With a build you should be able to:
 - Create a new appliance
 - Run a instance with that build
 - Deploy to host (it's like a pre-deploy)


On a related note, the concept of a build target is that you have some
kind of package with a specific version. One build can be found from a
target.

To get started lets bootstrap and run `devin`:

```
# this will take sometime
priv/build-targets.sh alpine/edge devin/edge
spew-build run spew.dev devin/edge --bind $PWD:/app /bin/sh
curl -o /root/.mix/archives/hex.ez https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.hex.pm/installs/1.0.0/hex.ez"
```
