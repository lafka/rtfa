A build is something to run.

With a build you should be able to:
 - Create a new appliance
 - Run a instance with that build
 - Deploy to host (it's like a pre-deploy)


On a related note, the concept of a build target is that you have some
kind of package with a specific version. One build can be found from a
target.
