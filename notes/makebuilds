A build a is spew archive

They have some meta info stored in SPEWMETA, then the rest is the
rootfs that we will use to run from.

You can use any linux distro by using debootstrap, pacstrap or
similar. This document describes how to build most of the stuff using
alpine linux.


Most of the things we will be building will be using erlang/elixir.
For that reason we need a build for development and generating
releases.

To bootstrap the initial alpine system we need a copy of `apk`. This
may be available in your repository, otherwise can be found here[1].

Once we have our base system setup with (script will be added, in the
meantime checkout[2]) alpine-sdk included and a copy of
git://dev.alpinelinux.org/aports . we can build elixir.

All the tooling for building nif's etc will already be there.
