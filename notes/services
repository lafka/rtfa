# Services

Service describes what instance(s) must be running to deliver
something.

For instance `database` might be a service that contains:
	- service:riak
	- service:redis
	- service:influxdb

where `service:riak`:
	- instance:* -> appliance.name == 'riak'

`metrics` might be a different service that includes
	- service:influxdb
	- service:grafana



There is no way to control the options of an appliance or a instance
through a service. Instead it just describes what must be running.

In the future if we add some kind of metric integration we can then
look at the performance of the service and export that to someplace
(i.e. a status page)
